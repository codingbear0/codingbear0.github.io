저자가 서문에서 밝히 듯 사람들은 [[/notes/lean-startup|Lean Startup]] 방법론의 상위 개념[^1]만 이해하고 실제로 어떻게 적용해야 할지를 몰라 어려움을 겪는데, 그 간극을 메꾸기 위한 안내서이다.

<BR />

product-market fit을 달성하기 위해 Product-Market Fit Pyramid와 The Lean Product Process를 제안하고 있다[^1].
- Product-Market Fit Pyramid
- The Lean Product Process의 6단계:
	1. Determine your target customers
	2. Identify underserved customer needs
	3. Define your value proposition
	4. Specify your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set
	5. Create your MVP prototype
	6. Test your MVP with customers

The Lean Product Process는 Product-Market Fit Pyramid의 바닥부터 한 단계씩 위로 올라갈 수 있도록 해줌.

[^1]: ‘Product-Market Fit Pyramid’는 프레임워크, ‘The Lean Product Process’는 프로세스.
