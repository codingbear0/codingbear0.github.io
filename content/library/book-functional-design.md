> [!quote] This is a book for programmers in the trenches who want to learn how to use functional programming languages to get real things done. As such, I will not spend any appreciable time on the more theoretical aspects of functional programming such as Monads, Monoids, Functors, Categories, and so on. $\cdots$  If you are interested in functional theory, I recommend the writings of Mark Seemann.
- 단, Monads, Monoids, Functors, Categories 같은 functional theory과 관련된 개념은 자세히 설명하지 않으니, Mark Seemann의 책 참조[^1].
