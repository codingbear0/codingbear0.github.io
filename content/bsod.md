> [!quote] $\cdots$ the Blue Screen of Death (also known as a Stop error) in the Windows NT family was actually designed by Microsoft developer John Vert $\cdots$ Additionally, John Vert stated that the Stop error screens were assigned the color blue because the universal color palette of the video hardware at that time was very rudimentary and he personally used a MIPS OS box and SlickEdit for programming, $\cdots$
- John Vert에 의해 개발되었고,
- 화면이 파란색인 이유는 비디오 하드웨어의 universal color palette가 제한적이었기 때문.
