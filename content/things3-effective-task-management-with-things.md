> [!quote] I might schedule a task on a specific day, but that’s meant as a guideline, not a rule. If something MUST be done on time, I add a deadline. I barely assign deadlines to tasks, which makes them even more powerful when I do. 

- 가이드라인으로써 일정 설정:
    - 꼭 지정된 시간에 끝마쳐야 할 일이 있다면 데드라인<sub>deadline</sub> 설정.
	- 데드라인을 최소화 할 수록 효과가 더 좋음.

> [!note] [[book-rework|Rework]]의 “빨리빨리는 독이다.”와 같은 맥락.

> Things doesn’t scream at you. Didn’t get to that task you scheduled yesterday? No problem, it’s been rescheduled to today. Things doesn’t care. It won’t shame you with a big OVERDUE badge. Things exists to serve, not control.

> When I schedule a task on a specific day, ==it’s meant as a guideline, not a rule.==


> When I decide to do something “some time next week”, I schedule it on the next Monday. Then when I’m scheduling my week on Monday, I’ll scheduled it more specifically. 
  
`#`: 이런 방법도 괜찮아 보인다. 다음 주에 할 일은 일단 다음 주 월요일로 일정을 설정해 놓고, 다음 주 월요일이 되면 일정을 상세하게 다시 정하고.`


> I don’t only use the inbox for tasks, but also for random thoughts, links I want to remember… Anything goes. When I have a spare moment, I open my Inbox and triage its contents. Some things get assigned to a section, some get scheduled, others might belong in an entirely different app. 

`#`: Inbox에 할 일, 아이디어, 링크 등등을 가볍게 기록하고, 시간이 나면 분류하고, 일정을 정하고, 아니면 아예 다른 앱으로 옮기고. Inbox를 말 그대로 Inbox로 쓴다?

> Things looks pretty empty in these screenshots. While some sections are a lot more active at times,in general I try to keep it calm.

> The primary use of my task manager is scheduling tasks in the short term. If Things looks crowded, I should reconsider my schedule.
