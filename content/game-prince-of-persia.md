> [!quote] Some background: This archive contains the source code for the original Prince of Persia game that I wrote on the Apple II, in 6502 assembly language, between 1985-89. 
- 2012년 Apple II에서 구동하는 전체 source code를 GitHub에 공개:
    - [[assembly-6502|6502 assembly]]로 작성 [^1].

[^1]: Assembly 83.8%

> [!quote] Beyond that, please don't ask me to explain anything about the source code, because I don't remember! I hung up my 6502 programming guns in October 1989, and after two decades working primarily as a writer, game designer, and creative director, to say my coding skills are rusty would be an understatement.
- 기억 못하니까 source code에 대해선 물어보지 말라고. 😆
